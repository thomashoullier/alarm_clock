# FreeCAD alarm clock
This is a FreeCAD project modeling an alarm clock. I have a real alarm clock
on my desk and reproduced it in FreeCAD as an exercise.

## Parts diagram
The following diagram lists all the parts on an exploded view.

## Animating
The animation of assemblies for the purpose of producing exploded views is
controlled by the variable `explode` in the file `master_animator`.
